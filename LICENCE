GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 2025 VICTOR XEQUE

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                       Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software
are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By
contrast, our license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share
and change all versions of a programâ€”to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. 

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code
or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software and
use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you are informed
that you can do these things.

Accordingly, our General Public License is designed to make sure
that you can use the software freely, and that you can share it
with others. 

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
   a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
   distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The
   "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a
   "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
   derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
   containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or
   with modifications and/or translated into another language.
   (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the
   term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
   source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
   conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
   appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
   intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
   absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
   Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
   of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
   distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
   above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

   b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
   in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or
   any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all
   third parties under the terms of this License.

   c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
   when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
   interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
   announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
   notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
   a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
   these conditions, and telling the user how to get the source
   code. (This is not required for noninteractive use.)

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
   under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
   terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of
   the following:

   a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
   source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
   1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
   interchange; or,

   b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
   years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
   cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
   machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
   distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
   customarily used for software interchange.

   c) If you have not distributed the Program in source code form,
   you may not distribute it in object code or executable form at
   all.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
   except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
   otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program
   is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
   License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
   from you under this License will not have their licenses
   terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
   signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to
   modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These
   actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
   Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
   based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
   License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for
   copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on
   it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
   original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
   subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any
   further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
   granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
   by third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
   issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
   agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
   License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
   License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
   your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
   obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
   Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
   royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
   receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
   way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
   refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

8. It is not the purpose of this License to induce you to
   infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest
   validity of any such claims; this License has the sole purpose of
   protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
   system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
   people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
   software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
   application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to
   decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any
   other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

9. If any portion of this License is held invalid or unenforceable
   under any particular circumstance, the balance of the License is
   intended to apply and the License as a whole is intended to
   apply in other circumstances.

10. The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be
    included in all copies or substantial portions of the Program.

11. THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES
    OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
    NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT
    HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
    WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
    OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAM OR THE USE OR OTHER
    DEALINGS IN THE PROGRAM.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
